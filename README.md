 # Best Practices for Prompting and Collaboration in Development

## Analysis of Prompting Method and Recommendations

**1. Integration of Fixes and Complete Code Rewrite**

**Best Practice:**
- When a fix or feature is requested, rewriting the code to integrate the modifications is an excellent method to ensure the code is coherent and functions as expected.

**Argumentation:**
- **Clarity and Coherence:** Rewriting the code allows for all modifications to be integrated coherently, ensuring all parts of the code align with the new features.
- **Documentation and Understanding:** Providing an ultra-precise description of the code after rewriting helps understand the code's functionality and facilitates future adjustments.

**Example:**
When a fullscreen feature was added, the code was rewritten to include this feature, with detailed explanations on each modified part.

**2. Reporting Console Anomalies**

**Best Practice:**
- Reporting console errors precisely and clearly helps identify and resolve issues more quickly.

**Argumentation:**
- **Effective Debugging:** Providing specific error messages allows targeting precisely where the code is problematic, facilitating debugging.
- **Clear Communication:** Explaining the context and conditions under which the error occurs helps understand the overall problem and find suitable solutions.

**Example:**
When a video loading error was reported (`index.html:328 [Violation] Added non-passive event listener`), it allowed correcting the addition of a passive event listener to improve page responsiveness.

**3. Precise Feedback During Tests**

**Best Practice:**
- Providing detailed feedback on the code's behavior after each test allows for targeted and effective adjustments.

**Argumentation:**
- **Continuous Improvement:** Precise feedback helps understand exactly what works or doesnâ€™t, allowing for incremental and targeted adjustments.
- **Collaboration and Adjustments:** Clear feedback facilitates collaboration, ensuring modifications meet exact expectations.

**Example:**
When the mosaic mode did not work as expected, detailed feedback helped understand that videos were aligned in a single column instead of multiple, leading to a revision of the CSS and container behavior.
